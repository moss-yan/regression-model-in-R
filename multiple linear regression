# Business questions:
 # 1. Do weekend BIXI trips tend to last longer?
 # 2. How do weather conditions affect trip duration? Is the impact of weather conditions further accentuated on weekends?
 # 3. Are there any seasonal effects on trip duration?

# Y duration = a0 + a1 * X1 weekend + a2 * X2 temperature + a3 * X3 rainfall + a4 * month + a5 * station + e

# read the data, change the address if you need to reproduce
bixi4_part1<-read.csv("C:/Users/MossY/OneDrive/Desktop/Statistic Modelling/project 1/bixi4_part1.csv")
head(bixi4_part1)

# new column should be: weekend (if day=(6,7), 1, 0)
bixi4_part1$is_weekend <- ifelse(bixi4_part1$jj >= 6, 1, 0)

# fit a multiple linear model (mod1) - without location
mod1<-lm(dur~is_weekend+temp+precip+mm,data=bixi4_part1)
summary(mod1)

# fit a multiple linear model - with station
